# In Pursuits of Full Stack Development with JS ðŸš€
  

> [@siwalik](https://github.com/siwalikm) created this short to-do list of study topics for preparing to be a
> full stack javascript developer in a course of the next couple of
> months.
>
> I'm making some changes to make my own path, for now I'm only keeping free resources
> but that can change also I'm goin to use primarily React.js as a front-end library/API/framework
> it's what I've work and what I'm aming to master 
> 
> In order to stay motivated and track your progress, I recommend you to fork this
> list and regularly commit to your repo with crossed out items as you progress.

>   - One for the main concepts (thats a basic one)
>   - Another for the advanced guides, these may take more than one they are more complex and complete and might need complementary ones
>   - And a final one for the hooks
